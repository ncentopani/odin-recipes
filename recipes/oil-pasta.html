    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Pasta aglio e olio is a great recipe when you're in need of a quick, simple and delicious meal! After trying
        this recipe you won't believe it only uses 5 simple ingredients! I prefer to use fettuccine, but you can substitute
        any long pasta of your liking!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked Fettuccine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsely</li>
        <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, 
            stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. 
            Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl. Save 1 cup of pasta water.</li>
        <li> While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. 
            Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. </li>
        <li>Pour in hot olive oil and garlic. Add pasta water to taste.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined. </li>
        <li> Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. </li>
    </ol>
