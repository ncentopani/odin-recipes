        <li>Next, add the garlic and red chilli flakes and cook for another minute until fragrant. 
            Stir in the chopped tomatoes and oregano and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>

        <li>Stir in all three types of beans and vegetable stock, bring to a boil, then 
            lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes until the beans are tender 
            and the soup has naturally thickened a bit.</li>

            and cover with a lid for 2-3 minutes to allow the spinach to wilt.</li>
