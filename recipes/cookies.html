    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>A perennial, all season dessert classic loved by adults and children alike! The chocolate chip cookie
        an icon of after (or before) dinner treats. In my opinion, nothing can compete with the crispy shell and gooey
        center of a perfectly baked chocolate chip cookie.
