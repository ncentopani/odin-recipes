    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>A perennial, all season dessert classic loved by adults and children alike! The chocolate chip cookie
        an icon of after (or before) dinner treats. In my opinion, nothing can compete with the crispy shell and gooey
        center of a perfectly baked chocolate chip cookie.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons hot water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, 
            stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. 
            Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl. Save 1 cup of pasta water.</li>
        <li> While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. 
            Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. </li>
        <li>Pour in hot olive oil and garlic. Add pasta water to taste.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined. </li>
        <li> Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. </li>
    </ol>
